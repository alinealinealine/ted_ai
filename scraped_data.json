The technology helps in controlling water parameters such as dissolved oxygen, ammonia, and nitrate levels, thereby creating a conducive environment for fish and shrimp growth. Water Conservation: Bio-floc technology promotes water conservation by minimizing the need for water exchange in aquaculture systems. The microbial communities formed in bio-floc tanks help in recycling nutrients and reducing water wastage, making it a sustainable approach to aquaculture. Cost Reduction: By reducing the dependence on water exchange and minimizing the usage of artificial feeds, the adoption of bio-floc technology can potentially lead to cost savings for fish and shrimp farmers. This can contribute to the economic viability of aquaculture operations. Environmental Sustainability: The implementation of bio-floc technology aligns with the goal of environmental sustainability in aquaculture. The technology reduces the release of effluents into natural water bodies, mitigating the potential negative impacts on the environment. Skill Development and Capacity Building: The initiative may include training and capacity-building programs for farmers, providing them with knowledge and skills related to bio-floc technology and its application in aquaculture.

The technology helps in controlling water parameters such as dissolved oxygen, ammonia, and nitrate levels, thereby creating a conducive environment for fish and shrimp growth. Water Conservation: Bio-floc technology promotes water conservation by minimizing the need for water exchange in aquaculture systems. The microbial communities formed in bio-floc tanks help in recycling nutrients and reducing water wastage, making it a sustainable approach to aquaculture. Cost Reduction: By reducing the dependence on water exchange and minimizing the usage of artificial feeds, the adoption of bio-floc technology can potentially lead to cost savings for fish and shrimp farmers. This can contribute to the economic viability of aquaculture operations. Environmental Sustainability: The implementation of bio-floc technology aligns with the goal of environmental sustainability in aquaculture. The technology reduces the release of effluents into natural water bodies, mitigating the potential negative impacts on the environment. Skill Development and Capacity Building: The initiative may include training and capacity-building programs for farmers, providing them with knowledge and skills related to bio-floc technology and its application in aquaculture.
